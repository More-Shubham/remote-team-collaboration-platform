- Database
  - Implement a database like PostgreSQL or MySQL for structured data (user accounts, projects, tasks). Consider NoSQL solutions like MongoDB or Firebase for flexible data models (chat messages, file attachments).
- Communication
  - Integrate real-time communication tools like WebSockets or Socket.IO to enable features like instant messaging, live chat, and video conferencing.
- Cloud Platform
  - Utilize cloud services like Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Amazon Web Services (AWS) for scalability, reliability, and easy deployment.
